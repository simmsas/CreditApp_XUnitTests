Task

Create a REST service in C# that will be used in credit applications to return a decision and interest rate.
- The service should accept a credit amount, the term (repayment in months), current preexisting credit amount
- Validation should check for necessary inputs
- No requirement to log the request
- There is no need to implement security at this time
- Consider which unit tests are required

The service should return a decision and an interest rate percentage, based on the following rules:

Applied amount / <2000 / >2000 / >69000
Decision          No      Yes      No

Total future debt / <20000 / 20000-39000 / 40000-59000  / >60000
Interest rate %        3          4             5           6
